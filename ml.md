If you were looking for machine learning, you've come to the **wrong** place. I slept through most of my undergraduate programming languages course and feel like I missed out on learning about functional programming&mdash;therefore, I'm taking it upon myself to self-study functional programming languages. I'm currently working through [_Elements of ML Programming_](http://infolab.stanford.edu/~ullman/emlp.html) by [Jeffrey D. Ullman](http://infolab.stanford.edu/~ullman/) and am posting my solutions here for personal accountability.
